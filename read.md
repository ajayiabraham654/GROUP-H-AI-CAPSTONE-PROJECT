Fall Armyworm Supervised AI Detection

**Project Overview**
This project develops a supervised AI model to detect the Fall Armyworm (FAW) from images.  
The goal is to create a deployable, performant AI model compatible with the ONNX format, enabling integration into real-world applications such as pest detection in crops.

**Contribution**
1. Verified dataset download and setup in Google Colab.
2. Prepared the environment for training YOLOv8 object detection.
3. Documented steps to run and explore the dataset in Colab.

 **How to Run**
1. Open the Google Colab notebook provided in the repository.
2. Run the dataset cell to download the Fall Armyworm dataset.
3. Run the training cell to start training the YOLOv8 model (if required).

* Complete model training and evaluation.
* Export the trained model to ONNX for deployment.

This README serves as documentation of initial setup and contribution.
